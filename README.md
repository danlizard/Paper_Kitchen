# Paper Kitchen
 A tool to help with creating paper MTG decks for friendly matches and testing.

# Requirements
 The scripts are all tested on Python 3.8.5, and will probably work on any versions yonger than 3.6
 - Libraries from requirements.txt
 - [Nuitka](https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka) is best used to compile standalone executables (don't forget to create a virtual env.)

# On the topic of piracy
 It stands to reason that no card printed on A4 paper is an actual MTG card, so please do not attempt to market or use them as such.
